[Prompt]
[Goal] List all predicates representing goals and their optional parameter sets.
[Action] List all the actions needed to achieve the goals.
[Predicate] List key predicates used within the actions.
[Object] List all key objects involved in the actions.
[Example] Provide several examples of Instruction to Goal mapping and the list of actions, predicates, and objects required to complete the task.

Prompt:
1. Analyze the given instruction to define specific goals. Begin your response with 'Goals:', and list goals using predicates connected by logical operators (&, |).
2. List all actions necessary to achieve these goals. Start with 'Actions:', and continue with a comma-separated list of the actions, simply as verbs followed by the objects.
3. Identify the key predicates involved in these actions. These should be only the action verbs. Begin with 'Key Predicate:', followed by a comma-separated list of these verbs.
4. List all key objects involved in these actions. These should be only the nouns representing items interacted with during the actions. Begin with 'Key Objects:', followed by a comma-separated list of these nouns.

5. Provide examples that demonstrate how instructions are mapped to goals, actions, key predicates, and key objects. Start each example with 'Example:', ensuring it aligns with the instructed formatting without using brackets or additional headings.
6. The object can only come from those listed above; if it does not exist, please replace it with the closest one listed above.
7. Produce directly interpretable predicate logic formulas, omitting any supplementary elucidations.
8. The format of the answers should refer to the above [Example], with "Goals:", "Actions:". ", "Key Predicates:", "Key Objects:" do not appear [], do not start "[Goals]", "[Actions]", "[Key Predicate]", "[Key Objects]". No line breaks are required.

Now, the given instruction is
