[Examples]


[Prompt]
[Condition] Lists all predicates representing conditions and their optional parameter sets.
[Action] Lists all the actions, specifying their associated costs in parentheses.
[Object] Lists all parameter sets.
[Example] Illustrates mappings from goals to Optimal Actions, Vital Action Predicates, and Vital Objects, which are essential for completing the tasks outlined in the instructions.
- Optimal Actions: The sequence of actions with the lowest total cost to achieve the goals.
- Vital Action Predicates: Action predicates representing the actions required to achieve the goals.
- Vital Objects: Nouns representing all items or entities involved in accomplishing the goals.


1. Your task is to analyze the given goal to identify the optimal actions, vital action predicates, and vital objects necessary for achieving the goals. The goal is presented in first-order logic, consisting of [Condition].
2. List all actions needed to accomplish these goals. Begin with 'Optimal Actions:' followed by a comma-separated list of actions, using an underscore between the verb and the object. Ensure that the action sequence minimizes the total cost.
3. Do not start with '[Optimal Actions]', but start with 'Optimal Actions:'.
3. Identify the essential action predicates used in these actions. These should only be the verbs representing each action. Begin with 'Vital Action Predicates:', followed by a comma-separated list of these verbs.
4. List all crucial objects used in these actions. These should only include the nouns representing items or entities interacted with. Begin with 'Vital Objects:', followed by a comma-separated list of these nouns.
5. The actions, predicates, and objects should come from the provided lists above. If an item does not exist, replace it with the closest available match.
6. Refer directly to the examples in [Example], using "Optimal Actions:", "Vital Action Predicates:", and "Vital Objects:" in the given format. Exclude any additional explanations, strictly following the example format without extra headings or line breaks.

Now, the given goals are
